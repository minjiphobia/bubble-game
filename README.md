casual play with threejs 

to make it work, close all browser tabs and open it with option `--allow-file-access-from-files` as follows:

`google-chrome-stable BubbleGame.html --allow-file-access-from-files`

**TO BE IMPROVED**: currently the program is manipulating the perspective camera instead of the bubble, which may yield wierd feeling when executing certain operation(im not gonna tell ya wut tis XD)
